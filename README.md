# DISSENSION
[Classic]()<br>
Here is DISSENSION that has been turned into a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) plugin.<br>
Note that DISSENSION is meant to be a mod on it's own, so deactivating it will only disable BD-dependant content.

## versions
You will find the "classic" versions under `version/core` and the newer versions under `versions/core_v2`. The core v2 versions must be used with the BD plugin. The plugin will auto-load the latest version on the spot.
