# DISSENSION
[Classic]()<br>
Here is DISSENSION that has been turned into a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) plugin.<br>
Note that DISSENSION is meant to be a mod on it's own, so deactivating it will only disable BD-dependant content.

## versions
You will find the "classic" versions under [`version/core`](./versions/core) and the newer versions under [`versions/core_v2`](./versions/core_v2). The core v2 versions must be used with the BD plugin. The plugin will auto-load the latest version on the spot.

## FRESH START!
The latest versions will now been made into a bookmarklet. New bookmarklet clients in [`versions/client_v2`](./versions/client_v2). You can snoop around in the core code in [`versions/core_v3`](./versions/core_v3)
