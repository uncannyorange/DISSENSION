# DISSENSION
## versions
Clients are in [`versions/client_v2`](./versions/client_v2). You can snoop around in the core code in [`versions/core_v3`](./versions/core_v3)
<br/>

## classic versions
You will find the "classic" versions under [`version/core`](./versions/core) and the versions used by the old BD plugin under [`versions/core_v2`](./versions/core_v2). The BD versions are pretty much garbage and the older versions somehow still mildly work, but they're all deprecated.
